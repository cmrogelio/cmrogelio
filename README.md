## Hello there 🧔🏼‍♂️👋

My name is Rogelio Cedeño Moreno, and I'm a Phd in Mecatronics (applied Machine learning) specialice in the development and deployment of Machine learning models for the medical and industrial fields.

- 🔭 I currently work as a lead computer vision specialist developing biomechanical analyses for dynamic tasks, such as measuring the Q angle and the transition from sitting to standing.

- 🌱 I am currently learning best practices for implementing models through Azure with proper MLOps oversight and CI/CD methodologies, and I am open to discussing and continuing to learn from anyone interested in sharing some of their experience.
  
- 👯 I am seeking a position as a machine learning engineer or MLOps engineer, as I want to test and refine my skills and knowledge.

- 💬 Ask me about any of my research projects related to biomechanical analysis, which have been documented and presented as scientific articles that can be consulted at [Vision-based AI system for fall risk](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.108983) and [SAE-based for gait feature analysis](https://doi.org/10.3390/app14093867)

- 📫 You can contact me at rogelio.ced.mor@outlook.com or through my LinkedIn profile [Rogelio Cedeño](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogelio-cedeno-29b6a5334)

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love 3D printing and I'm always willing to learn something new about hardware, software, painting, processing, etc.
